                <li>How to use CSS to hide all sections except the one you have clicked. The idea is to mimic the nav bar in your main site, the user will click a "link" in your nav tag that will hide all the sections on the page and ONLY display info of the section of choice. So if you click on the word "Best locations" in the nav bar, it will only display the "best locations" section on the page and hide the rest so the user can't scroll to see it.</li>
