            <h1>My Story</h1>
            <p>Hi! I'm De'Shonda Wimbish and the baker behind this sweet journey. I started in 2017, baking and selling desserts right from my home kitchen. From the very beginning, I’ve been passionate about creating glamorous cakes, cupcakes, and treats that are just as beautiful as they are delicious.<br>
                I am committed to combining flavor and artistry to make every dessert amazing and memorable. What began as a home-based dream has now grown into a small business I’m proud to run in Zebulon, North Carolina.<br>
                Whether you're celebrating something special or simply craving something sweet, desserts from Nit Picky Confections desserts will be unforgettable.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Expect to be amazed—my desserts speak for themselves!</strong></p>
